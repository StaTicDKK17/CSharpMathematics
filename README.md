# CSharpMathematics
A C# Class library with abstractions and lots of mathematical structures purely for the challenge of doing it. 

# Current structures being implemented
- Matrix
- Vector
- Set

# Testing strategy
This project tries to be as reliable as possible. This means that the testing strategy
I and decided to use for this project is whitebox testing where I try to have the 
highest possible coverage rate. The coverage and report are being generated by 
coverlet-collector and dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool.
