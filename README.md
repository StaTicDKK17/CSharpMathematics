# CSharpMathematics
A .NET class library that contains lots of methods, algorithms and structures for mathematics. The project is WIP and is for the time being only done by the author of the project.

# Current structures being implemented
- Matrix
- Vector
- Set

# Structure of the Project
There are 2 parts of this repository. The testing project and the class library itself. All structures are implementing an interface, that makes it easier to make specialized versions of certain mathematical structures. 

The class library currently have 2 namespace being:
- Matrix
- Vector

These contain the interfaces and classes for vectors and matrices.

# Testing strategy
This project tries to be as reliable as possible. This means that the testing strategy
I and decided to use for this project is whitebox testing where I try to have the 
highest possible coverage rate. The coverage and report are being generated by 
coverlet-collector and dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool.

# How to run the tests:
In the repo there is a powershell file that has the 4 commands used to run the tests and generate the report. Simply open powershell, navigate to the folder with the GenerateReport.ps1 file and run it. Now two folders will be generated, Report and TestResults, the report will be inside the Report folder. Simple open index.html for all results.
